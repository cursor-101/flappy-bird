# Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a simple clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, implemented using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

## Game Description

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game is an endless runner, with the player's score increasing for each set of pipes successfully navigated.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the mouse or press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
3. Navigate through the gaps between the pipes.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Features

- Responsive bird character that responds to player input
- Randomly generated pipes for endless gameplay
- Score tracking

## Future Improvements

Some potential areas for future enhancement include:
